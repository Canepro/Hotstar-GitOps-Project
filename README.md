# Deploying a Secure Hotstar Clone with GitOps & Kubernetes

As a DevOps enthusiast, I had tinkered with CI/CD pipelines before, but I realized I had never truly built a project that integrated DevOps + Security (DevSecOps) + GitOps principles end-to-end. That’s when the idea struck:

Why not try building a Hotstar clone, and then deploy it with a full DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline?

That single thought kicked off my journey.

The Challenge I Set for Myself
I didn’t want this to be just another CI/CD demo. Instead, I set three goals:

Security First → Integrate DevSecOps practices (image scanning, secret management, policy enforcement).
Automation Everywhere → Use GitOps to make deployments hands-off, traceable, and rollback-friendly.
Real-World Use Case → Use a media-streaming clone (Hotstar-like) so it feels relevant and fun.
It sounded ambitious at first… but that’s what made it exciting.

**The Tech Stack I Chose**

I carefully picked a stack that mirrors what real-world teams use today:

Kubernetes → The foundation for container orchestration.
GitHub + GitOps (ArgoCD/Flux) → Every config change flows through Git, the single source of truth.
Docker → Containerized the Hotstar clone app.
CI/CD (GitHub Actions/Jenkins) → Automated builds, tests, and deployments.
Security Tools → Image scanning (Trivy), secret management (Sealed Secrets), policy enforcement (OPA/Gatekeeper).
Monitoring & Logging → Prometheus + Grafana for observability.
With this arsenal, I felt ready to bring my Hotstar clone to life.

**The Journey: Building the Pipeline**
**Step 1: Containerizing the Hotstar Clone**
The first step was packaging the app into Docker. That was straightforward, but I had to ensure:

No secrets inside images.
Used a lightweight base image.
Ran as a non-root user.

**Step 2: Adding Security Gates in CI/CD**
Before anything reached production, my pipeline enforced:

Static Code Analysis → Checking for vulnerabilities early.
Docker Image Scanning → Using Trivy to block insecure builds.
Policy Checks → Rejecting configs that violated security rules.

**Step 3: GitOps for Deployment**
Here’s where the magic happened. Instead of manually deploying, I connected ArgoCD to my Git repo.

Every commit to main automatically synced to Kubernetes.
Rollbacks were as simple as reverting a Git commit.
Full history of deployments → just by looking at Git logs.

**Step 4: Monitoring & Alerts**
Finally, I wired Prometheus and Grafana to watch everything: CPU usage, memory, errors, and stream performance.
This way, the system wasn’t just automated — it was observable.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
https://github.com/ophircloud/Hotstar-GitOps-Project.git

**Step 2: Navigate into the Project**
ls
cd Hotstar-GitOps-project
ls

**Step 3: Create S3 Buckets for Terraform State**
These buckets will store terraform.tfstate files.
cd s3-buckets/
ls
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve

✅ 3. AWS Console

Log in to the AWS S3 Console.
bucket name : hotstaarumullaa
bucket name : hotstaaluru
Search for your bucket name in the list.
If it’s there, it was created successfully.

**Step 4: Create Network**
Navigate to Terraform EC2 folder:
cd ../terraform_main_ec2

**2. Run Terraform:**

terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply -auto-approve

example output :
Apply complete! Resources: 24 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.
Outputs:
jumphost_public_ip = “18.208.229.108”
region = “us-east-1”

**3. The command terraform state list is used to list all resources tracked in your current Terraform state file.**

terraform state list

**Step 5: Connect to EC2 and Access Jenkins**
Go to AWS Console → EC2
Click your instance → Connect
Once connected, switch to root:
sudo -i

**4. DevOps Tool Installation Check & Version Report**

  [Git]="git --version"
  [Java]="java -version"
  [Jenkins]="jenkins --version"
  [Terraform]="terraform -version"
  [Maven]="mvn -v"
  [kubectl]="kubectl version --client --short"
  [eksctl]="eksctl version"
  [Helm]="helm version --short"
  [Docker]="docker --version"
  [Trivy]="trivy --version"
  [SonarQube]="docker ps | grep sonar"
  [Grafana]="kubectl get pods -A | grep grafana"
  [Prometheus]="kubectl get pods -A | grep prometheus"
  [AWS_CLI]="aws --version"
  [MariaDB]="mysql --version"
**5. Get the initial Jenkins admin password:**

cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

example output : 0c39f23132004d508132ae3e0a7c70e4
Copy that password!

Step 6: Jenkins Setup in Browser
Open browser and go to:
http://<EC2 Public IP>:8080
2. Paste the password from last step.
3. Click Install suggested plugins
4. Create first user:
Click through: Save and Continue → Save and Finish → Start using Jenkins

🔌 Step :7 Install Jenkins Plugin
Jenkins Dashboard → Manage Jenkins
Go to: Plugins
Click Available plugins
Search for:
pipeline: stage view
Docker
Docker Pipeline
Kubernetes
Kubernetes CLI
5. Install it

Step 8: Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job (Create EKS Cluster)
Go to Jenkins Dashboard
Click New Item
Name it: eks-terraform
Select: Pipeline
Click OK
Pipeline:
Definition : Pipeline script from SCM
SCM : Git
Repositories : https://github.com/ophircloud/Hotstar-GitOps-Project.git
Branches to build : */master
Script Path : eks-terraform/eks-jenkinsfile
Apply
Save
6. click Build with Parameters

ACTION :
Select Terraform action : apply
Build
7. To verify your EKS cluster, connect to your EC2 jumphost server and run:

aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name project-eks
kubectl get nodes
Step 9: Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job (Create Elastic Container Registry (ecr))
Go to Jenkins Dashboard
Click New Item
Name it: ecr-terraform
Select: Pipeline

7. To verify your EKS cluster, connect to your EC2 jumphost server and run:

aws ecr describe-repositories --region us-east-1
Step 10: Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job for Build and Push Docker Images to ECR
🔐 Step 10.1: Add GitHub PAT to Jenkins Credentials

Navigate to Jenkins Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Credentials → (global) → Global credentials (unrestricted).
Click “Add Credentials”.
In the form:
Kind: Secret text
